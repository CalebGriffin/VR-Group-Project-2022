Pseudocode for how I want the AI's shooting to work:

variables:

    - a list containing all of the possible squares
    - a dictionary with the previous moves and whether they hit or sunk
    - a list of positions in target mode called the target stack

Make a Decision:

    if the ai is in target mode and previous shot was a hit:
        for each of the positions surrounding the previous position (N,E,S,W):
            if the position is in the list of possible squares and isn't in the target stack:
                add the position to the end of the target stack
        call the Target method

    else if the ai is in target mode and the previous shot was a miss:
        call the Target method

    else:
        call the Hunt method

Target:

    if the target stack is not empty:
        shoot at the first position in the target stack (remove it from the possible squares and the target stack)
        if the shot was a hit and sunk:
            for each position in the target stack:
                remove the position from the possible squares
            clear the target stack and set the ai to hunt mode

Hunt:

    choose a random element from the possible squares list and shoot at that position (remove it from the possible squares)
    if the position was a hit, set the ai to target mode

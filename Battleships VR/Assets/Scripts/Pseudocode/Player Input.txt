Pseudocode for how I want the Player input to work:

variables:

When a model boat enters the trigger area above the mini board:
    get the length of the model boat
    set the upper and lower bounds of the grid locking area based on the length of the boat and its rotation

When a model boat leaves the trigger area above the mini board:
    reset the upper and lower bounds of the grid locking area
    set the lock to point of the model boat back to the original position

While the model boat is within the trigger area above the mini board:
    if the boat hasn't been placed:
        take the position of the model boat and round it to the nearest position on the grid
        if the position doesn't already contain a boat or another object:
            update the position of the temporary boat on the grid at that position
